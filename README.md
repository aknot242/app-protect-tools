# NGINX App Protect Tools
This repo is a quickstart for using the [App Protect converter tools](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/configuration/#converter-tools) released in v2.3 in your CI/CD pipeline. The tool examples use Alpine in a Docker container to highlight that these tools can be used in a fast, yet ephemeral manner.

The available tools are:
- **Policy Converter** - 
Converts XML format ASM/AWAF security policy to App Protect JSON declarative format.

- **Signature Report Tool** - 
Exports signature metadata of the signatures installed on a system.

- **User-defined Signatures Converter** - 
Converts ASM/AWAF user-defined signatures to App Protect JSON format. While the Docker container in this repo can potentially be used to convert user-defined signatures, the scripts have not been implemented to do so at this time. 


## Dependencies
The examples below require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be installed on the host to function properly.

## App Protect Tool Instructions

Build the tools container:

``` shell
docker build -t app-protect-tools .
```
**NOTE:** If you need to change the signature package to be reported on, you must alter the Dockerfile to install the desired signature package, then rebuild the container before running the signature port commands.

### Policy Converter Tool
Run the policy converter:

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd)/tmp:/tmp --entrypoint "sh" app-protect-tools convert.sh
```

### Signature Report Tool
Run the signature report tool against the signatures installed when the container was built:

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd)/tmp:/tmp --entrypoint "sh" app-protect-tools signature-report.sh
```

Get the revision date of the signature package:

```shell
 cat tmp/signature-report.json | jq '.revisionDatetime'
```

Check which signatures are linked to CVEs:

```shell
cat tmp/signature-report.json | jq '.signatures[] | select(.hasCve==true)'
```

Or, get the count of the above"
```shell
cat tmp/signature-report.json | jq '[.signatures[] | select(.hasCve==true)] | length'
```

Find a specific signature by ID:

```shell
cat tmp/signature-report.json | jq '.signatures[] | select(.signatureId==200000018)'
```

## Deploys BIG-IP in AWS Cloud

This Terraform module deploys N-nic F5 BIG-IP in AWS cloud,and with module count feature we can also deploy multiple instances of BIG-IP.

## Prerequisites

This module is supported from Terraform 0.13 version onwards.

It is tested against following provider/terraform versions 

Terraform v0.13.0

+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.8.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v2.3.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.1.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v2.1.2

## Releases and Versioning

This module is supported in the following bigip and terraform version

| BIGIP version | Terraform 0.13 | 
|---------------|----------------|
| BIG-IP 15.x  | X |
| BIG-IP 14.x  | X |
| BIG-IP 13.x  | X |

## Password Management

By default bigip module will have random password setting to give dynamic password generation

```
cat terraform-aws-bigip-module/variables.tf

variable aws_secretmanager_auth {
  description = "Whether to use key vault to pass authentication"
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}

Outputs:

bigip_password = [
  "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
]

```

To use AWS secret manager password,we have to enable the variable "aws_secretmanager_auth" to true and supply the secret name to variable "aws_secretmanager_secret_id"

```
cat terraform-aws-bigip-module/variables.tf

variable aws_secretmanager_auth {
  description = "Whether to use key vault to pass authentication"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable aws_secretmanager_secret_id {
  description = "AWS Secret Manager Secret ID that stores the BIG-IP password"
  type        = string
  default     = "tf-aws-bigip-bigip-secret-9759"
} 

Outputs:

bigip_password = [
  "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
]

```

## Example Usage

We have provided some common deployment [examples](https://github.com/f5devcentral/terraform-aws-bigip-module/tree/master/examples)

#### Note
There should be one to one mapping between subnet_ids and securitygroup_ids (for example if we have 2 or more external subnet_ids,we have to give same number of external securitygroup_ids to module)

Users can have dynamic or static private ip allocation.If primary/secondary private ip value is null, it will be dynamic or else static private ip allocation.

```
With Static private ip allocation we can assign primary and secondary private ips for external interfaces, whereas primary private ip for management
and internal interfaces.
```

If it is static private ip allocation we can't use module count as same private ips will be tried to allocate for multiple 
bigip instances based on module count.

With Dynamic private ip allocation,we have to pass null value to primary/secondary private ip declaration and module count will be supported.

#### Note
```
Sometimes it is observed that the given static primary and secondary private ips may get exchanged. This is the limitation present in aws.
```
Below example snippets show how this module is called ( Dynamic private ip allocation )

```

#Example 1-NIC Deployment Module usage
#
module bigip {
  count                  = var.instance_count
  source                 = "../../"
  prefix                 = "bigip-aws-1nic"
  ec2_key_name           = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids        = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
}

#
#Example 2-NIC Deployment Module usage
#
module bigip {
  count                  = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-aws-2nic"
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = ""}]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
}

#
#Example 3-NIC Deployment  Module usage
#
module bigip {
  count                  = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-aws-3nic"
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = ""}]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false, "private_ip_primary" = ""}]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
}

#
#Example 4-NIC Deployment  Module usage(with 2 external public interfaces,one management and internal interface.There should be one to one mapping between subnet_ids and securitygroupids)
#

module bigip {
  count                  = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-aws-4nic"
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true }]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true },{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_external2", "public_ip" = true }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external","securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false }]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
}

Similarly we can have N-nic deployments based on user provided subnet_ids and securitygroup_ids.
With module count, user can deploy multiple bigip instances in the aws cloud (with the default value of count being one )


```
#### Below is the example snippet for private ip allocation

```
Example 3-NIC Deployment with static private ip allocation

module bigip {
  source                      = "../../"
  count                       = var.instance_count
  prefix                      = format("%s-3nic", var.prefix)
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  aws_secretmanager_secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret.bigip.id
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = aws_subnet.mgmt.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "10.0.1.4"}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = [module.mgmt-network-security-group.this_security_group_id]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = [module.external-network-security-group-public.this_security_group_id]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = [module.internal-network-security-group-public.this_security_group_id]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = aws_subnet.external-public.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "10.0.2.4", "private_ip_secondary" = "10.0.2.5"}]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = aws_subnet.internal.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "10.0.3.4"}]
}
```

### BIG-IP Automation Toolchain InSpec Profile for testing readiness of Automation Tool Chain components 

After the module deployment, we can use inspec tool for verifying the Bigip connectivity along with ATC components

This InSpec profile evaluates the following:

* Basic connectivity to a BIG-IP management endpoint ('bigip-connectivity')
* Availability of the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding')
* Version reported by the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding-version')
* Availability of the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services')
* Version reported by the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services-version')
* Availability of the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming')
* Version reported by the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming-version')
* Availability of the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service ('bigip-cloud-failover-extension')
* Version reported by the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service('bigip-cloud-failover-extension-version')

#### run inspec tests

we can either run inspec exec command or execute runtests.sh in any one of example nic folder which will run below inspec command

inspec exec inspec/bigip-ready  --input bigip_address=$BIGIP_MGMT_IP bigip_port=$BIGIP_MGMT_PORT user=$BIGIP_USER password=$BIGIP_PASSWORD do_version=$DO_VERSION as3_version=$AS3_VERSION ts_version=$TS_VERSION fast_version=$FAST_VERSION cfe_version=$CFE_VERSION
